## Description

This is a simple palindrome checker that checks if a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).
The project uses JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and check for palindromes. It includes a simple user interface where users can input a string and see if it is a palindrome.

## Features

- Input field for users to enter a string
- Button to check if the input string is a palindrome
- Display of the result (true or false)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Basic styling for better user experience
- Clear button to reset the input field and result
- Error handling for invalid inputs
