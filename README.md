# 🎓 FreeCodeCamp Certification Projects

This repository contains **15 certification projects** I completed as part of the following three FreeCodeCamp courses:

- ✅ Responsive Web Design
- ✅ JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
- ✅ Front End Development Libraries

Each course includes **five projects** that demonstrate my understanding of the concepts and technologies taught in the course. This repo serves as both a personal portfolio and proof of certification.
